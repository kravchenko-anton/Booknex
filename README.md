# Booknex 📚
Booknex is a cross-platform mobile app that is built using the React Native framework. It is designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and feature-rich, providing users with a powerful tool for discovering new books, managing their reading progress, and keeping track of their book collections.

The app has a sleek and modern interface that is easy to navigate, and it allows users to search for books by author, title, or keyword. Users can also browse through curated lists of popular books, new releases, and staff picks, or view personalized recommendations based on their reading history.

Once a user finds a book they are interested in, they can read detailed descriptions, view cover art, and read reviews from other users. They can also add the book to their personal reading list or collection, or mark it as "currently reading" to track their progress.

Booknex also includes a barcode scanner feature, allowing users to easily add books to their collection by scanning the ISBN barcode on the back of the book. Users can also manually add books by entering the title, author, and other book details.

The app features a built-in reading progress tracker, which allows users to log their progress through each book, set reading goals, and receive reminders to keep them on track. Users can also see their reading history, view statistics about their reading habits, and share their progress with friends and social media.

In summary, Booknex is an all-in-one app for book lovers, providing a powerful search tool, personalized recommendations, and a convenient way to manage reading progress and book collections
